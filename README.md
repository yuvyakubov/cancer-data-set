# cancer-dataset
The goal of this project is to apply a predictive model to the breast cancer dataset, to predict if a patient that previously had cancer will have a reoccurence of cancer. Since one of the predictive models is a general linear model we want to interpret the effects of the covariates on the reccurence of cancer.
